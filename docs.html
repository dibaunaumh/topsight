    <h1>Topsight.js - Documentation</h1>

    <p>
        Topsight is a term coined by the computer scientist David Gelernter, to denote the ability to see the big picture of a complex system.
        <br>
        Topsight.js is an engine for constructing Zoomable UI, that enables seeing the big picture while still being able to zoom into the small details, just like in online maps.
        <br>
        An example for Zoomable UI is the presentation tool <a href="http://prezi.com/8cnbaa97_ssf/prezi-book-mastering-prezi-for-business-presentations/">Prezi</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The framework arrives with a set of basic artifacts (widgets), named after physical artifacts for intuitiveness:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>paper: for text input</li>
        <li>label: a text label</li>
        <li>wheel: a circle</li>
        <li>pipe: a connector line</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Artifacts are constructed as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>artifacts are always drawn in logical view: 0,0 - 100,100</li>
        <li>artifacts are constructed in the coordinates system of their container. the top container also has 0,0-100,100 coordinates.</li>
        <li>a context reference allows selecting other artifacts in the scene, using their name</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        For events handling, it uses the common JQuery syntax with selectors & event listeners.
